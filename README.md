# Sorting-of-Array-elements-in-8086-MP-Using-ALP
This mini project performs the ascending and descending operation over the array of elements taken entierly from the user.
This is an menu based programm that requires the user to enter the appropriate decisions/choice after every output.
This projects starts bys asking for the array elements. The size of the array is not previously determined in order to save the programm for the internam and external 
fragmentations. The size of the array is taken from the user when the user determines to give the array elements as the input. After this process the next is determining
if the user want to choose Ascending or Descending order of the array. User is free to choose any operation in any order in any number of time. 
This programm also allows the user to discard the array elements and choose to give the inputs once again at any time in the same output process without distroying the 
previous outputs. 
This project is made to handel the negative elements, positive elements and as well as the dublicate elements without giving the value error. 
This program usess Macro and Procedures entirely to call the menu, and also the sorting operations.
